## Brian Chrzanowski (brimonk)

I'm a software engineer focused on writing high quality, high performance systems. I'm most
passionate about compilers, operating systems, databases, and graphics, so it's only natural that I
have a copious amount of C programming experience, with enough assembly knowledge to evaluate a
compiler's output.
